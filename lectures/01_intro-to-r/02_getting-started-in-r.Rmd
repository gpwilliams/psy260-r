# How Do I Install R?
## Local Installation

.pull-left[
- To get started, at the very least you'll have to [download R from CRAN](https://www.r-project.org/).

- Choose a mirror from which to download R. Any will do.

- Select the distribution for your operating system. On Windows, click **install R for the first time**. On Mac/Linux click the most recent install version.

- You'll see a new page; For Windows, click on **"Download R [version number] for Windows."**.

# What is RStudio? How Do I Install It?
## Local Installation

.pull-left[

**Integrated Development Environment for R**: makes working with R and extensions to it easier.

- Download from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/).

- Select products and choose **RStudio**. Scroll down until you see **Download RStudio Desktop**.

```{r rstudio-products, echo = FALSE, out.width = 250, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
  "../../img/rstudio-products.png"
))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r rstudio-download, echo = FALSE, out.width = 300, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/rstudio-desktop-install.png"
))
```

- Click the **Download** button in the free tier and select the correct installer for your operating system.
]

# Getting Started in the Cloud

Alternatively, we can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) to do everything online.

.pull-left[
- This may be the **easiest** route, especially if your system is locked down (e.g. on University controlled computers).

- This may be a little more limited than using R on your machine, but **most things you need will be available without effort on your behalf**.
]

.pull-right[
```{r rstudiocloud-signup, echo = FALSE, out.width = 350, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="rstudio.cloud signup page"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/rstudio-cloud-signup.png"
))
```
]

- **Works with Chromebooks** etc. that do not allow local installs of R.

- Please note that [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) **has usage limits**. You can only work for 15 hours per month in it at the free tier. If you can, get a local install.

Sign up for an account by clicking sign up on the [homepage](https://rstudio.cloud/).

# Starting Your First Project

Assuming you're using a local installation of R/RStudio:

- Make a folder somewhere on your computer.
- Open RStudio.
- **Click File $\rightarrow$ New Project $\rightarrow$ New Directory $\rightarrow$ New Project**.
- Give this a name and save it somewhere you can access on your computer (e.g. Desktop)

Assuming you're using rstudio.cloud:

- Make a new Space and give it a name, then **click New Project**.

You now have a **folder and an rstudio project** for your work. You can put data and code in here, and all outputs will be saved in this place.

```{r project-directory, echo = FALSE, out.width = 350, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="creating a new project"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/project-directory.png"
))
```

---
# Now What?

Click File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Notebook. This will open an R notebook in the Editor.

```{r rstudio-interface, echo = FALSE, out.width = 500, fig.align = "center", fig.cap="RStudio Interface"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/rstudio-interface.png"
))
```

---
# Understanding the Editor

.pull-left[
```{r rstudio-interface2, echo = FALSE, out.width = 450, fig.cap="The RStudio Interface"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/rstudio-interface.png"
))
```
]

.pull-right[
**`r colorise("Editor", "purple")`** (top-left): Where you **write your code**. Anything you write here can be saved to the file.

**Console** (bottom-left): Where we run your code. Once code is entered here you cannot edit it. **Don't work in the console!!!**

**Environment** (top-right): Lists any **variables avaiable in your global environment**. More on this later.

]

**Files/Plots/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right): See any plots in your **working dirctory (i.e. in your project)**, view any recently created plots or help on how to use R functions.

# Working with Notebooks

After making a notebook (by clicking **File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Notebook**). Give your notebook a title by changing the text following `title:` at the top.

Notebooks are made up of:

.pull-left[
- **Markdown text**: which allows you to **write in plain English** (or other languages). You **add decoration** to text (e.g. italics, bold, links) using markdown commands. They have some examples in the text for you.

- **R code chunks**: These only accept R code. Press the play button to run the code.
]

.pull-right[
```{r r-notebook-example2, echo = FALSE, out.width = 450, fig.cap="An R Notebook"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/r-notebook-example2.png"
))
```
]

When you save your notebook, you can **preview it**. It will create an HTML file that contains your markdown text and r code with output made pretty.

---
# Preview Your Notebook

Make sure you press play on your code chunks. This will run your code and show you the output. When done, save your work (Command/Ctrl + S) and **click Preview**. You should see this:

```{r r-notebook-output, echo = FALSE, out.width = 350, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(c(
   "../../img/r-notebook-output.png"
))
```

# Avoiding Repetition

In **R code chunks**, we can code things up by hand, or make **functions** that allow us to repeat a sequence of commands easily. For example, let's say we want to add 1 to several numbers. 

.pull-left[
We could do it by hand:

```{r basic-addition}
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
```
]

.pull-right[
Or we could write a function, and apply this to our numbers:

```{r baisc-addition-function}
add_one <- function(x) {x + 1}

add_one(1)
add_one(2)
add_one(3)
```
]

# Making Life Easy with Pre-built Functions

Some developers make functions available to others as a **package**. 

- The two packages (or package of packages) we'll use are `tidyverse` and `here`. 

    - **Tidyverse**: has several functions for making working with data and creating plots easier.

    - **Here**: makes your R-scripts read and write files relative to where the project is. This means you can write scripts that work on any PC (not just your own).
    
This will be made clear once we start using these packages.

.pull-left[
You only need to **install a package once per computer** (or cloud project):

```{r install-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("here")
```
]

.pull-right[
But, you **must load the packages (or libraries) every time you start R**:

```{r load-libraries, eval = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("here")
```
]

# What Next?

Now we know the basics of R and RStudio, we'll learn how to code in R.
