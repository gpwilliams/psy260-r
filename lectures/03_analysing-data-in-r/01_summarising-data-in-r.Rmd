# Summarising Data

Individual data points are some **abstraction away from reality**, essentially removing some detail.

- Even with trial-level data, we will **summarise responses** in terms of reaction times or correct responses.

- This removes a lot of the details of the real experience, but allows us to **see patterns**.

- Similarly, we can summarise data from many participants in a number of ways to help communicate a pattern or idea.

We can present summaries of data as a **plot**, as a **table of descriptive statistics**, and make inferences and decisions based on summaries of the data by **modelling our data**.

---
# Descriptive Statistics

We often summarise data in terms of measures of **central tendency** and **dispersion**.

- **Central tendency**: What is the average score? This can be determined in a few ways.

    - **Mean**: used to describe data that are normally distributed. Can be misleading when outliers are present.

    - **Median**: used to describe data that are skewed in some way away from a normal distribution. Suppresses the impact of outliers.
    
.pull-left[
```{r central-tendency-mean}
noskew <- c(10, 20, 15, 20, 22)
mean(noskew)

skew <- c(10, 20, 15, 20, 2000)
mean(skew)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r central-tendency-median}
median(noskew)

median(skew)
```

]

---
# Descriptive Statistics

- **Dispersion**: The spread of scores (e.g. for individuals) around an average.

    - **Standard Deviation**: the spread of the data from the sample mean. With a normal distribution approximately 1, 2, and 3 *SD*s capture approximately 68, 95, and 99.7% of the data.

    - **Interquartile Range**: Rank orders data into four equal parts; the first region – or quartile – (i.e. 25%), the median (i.e. 50%), and the middle part of the third quartile (i.e. 75%). Used for non-normal data.
    
```{r dispersion}
# low variability in scores = low SD
low_dispersion <- c(10, 12, 8, 9, 11, 10, 10.5, 9, 11.5)
sd(low_dispersion)

# lots of variability in scores = high SD
high_dispersion <- c(10, 1000, 89, -400, 90, 880, 0)
sd(high_dispersion)
```

# Why Make these in R?

- **Scales up easily to new data**: If you write this code to analyse data from 10 participants, you can instantly rerun it for millions.

- **Easier to spot mistakes** when you're writing the recipe.

- **Easier to fix mistakes** with a minor modification instead of repeating every step of the analysis by hand.

- **Repeatability**: If you do a task once in R, you can copy and paste code for a new study. This saves a lot of time in the long run.

- **Reproducibility**: Allows others (and future you) to check work and inspect methods at every step. You'll make science more reliable!

# Summarise

Let's take a look at the inbuilt `starwars` data set in the `tidyverse` pacakage.

```{r starwars}
data(starwars) # load the data from within the package
glimpse(starwars) # view it
```
There's a lot of data here! How might we summarise this?

---
# Summarise

`summarise()` collapses across all observations in your data set to produce a single row of data.

- `summarise()` takes two main arguments: 

    - 1: what is the **data** set you want to summarise?
    - 2: additional information specifying **how you want to summarise it**.
    
Let's summarise the mean height of the Star Wars characters:

```{r summarise-height}
summarise(starwars, mean_height = mean(height))
```

Oops, we got NA! Why? R by default produces NA for any summary of data containing NA values. (You can't average something that isn't there.)

---
# Summarise

What should we do? We can make a new data set without NAs, or tell `mean()` to ignore them.

```{r summarise-height-na}
summarise(starwars, mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We set the argument **na.rm** in `mean()` to **TRUE**, meaning "Should R remove NAs? TRUE (yes)".

---
# Many Summaries

- What if we want to get **different types of summaries**? Imagine we want the count, mean, and standard deviation of height?

- We also can tell R to generate these summaries on the data by first **dropping any observations with missing values (NA)** in height.

```{r summarise-n-mean-sd}
summarise(
  drop_na(starwars, height), 
  n = n(),
  sd = sd(height),
  mean_height = mean(height)
)
```

- How might we interpret this? We have 81 measured heights of characters. The mean height is 174.36cm, while the standard deviation is 34.77. 

- **What's the SD mean**? With normally distributed data 95% of values fall within $\pm$ 1.96 SD of the mean; most are between 106.2 and 242cm tall!

---
# Grouping

- As we can see, the data set contains **very many species** of creates from the Star Wars universe. What if we want summaries of all of them?

- We can add an argument to our data in `summarise()` called `group_by()`.

- Within `group_by()`, we specify our data but also give a column by which to **group the summaries**.

```{r group-by-summarise, message=FALSE}
summarise(
  group_by(starwars, species), 
  mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

# The Pipe!

- So far, I've avoided showing you some R magic so you get the principles of functions. But R has a way to make code a lot more readable: the pipe!

- The pipe in R (`%>%`) **passes data from one function to another**.

```{r pipe-it, message=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

**You can now read left to right**: 1. take my data **and then** 2. group by species **and then** 3. summarise, creating the column mean height from the mean of the height column (removing NAs of course).

---
# Adding Complexity

We can **add as many groups as we like** to group by, and as many summaries as we like to summary. For example:

```{r many-group-summary, message=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  drop_na(height) %>% 
  group_by(sex, gender) %>% 
  summarise( 
    n = n(),
    sd = sd(height),
    mean_height = mean(height)
  )
```

---
# All Tidyverse Functions Work with the Pipe!

Let's keep only humans over 70kg in mass, and calculate their height and weight.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Human" & mass > 70) %>%
  drop_na(height) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_height = mean(height),
    sd_height = sd(height)
  )
```

*We could even add `select()` and `mutate()` in here if we wanted*.

# Recap

We've learned...

- Why we summarise data and recapped on basic **descriptive statistics**.

- **Why we might use R** to summarise our data.

- How to pass **optional arguments** to functions (e.g. na.rm in `mean()` and s`d()`).

- How to make **separate summaries per group** using `group_by()`.

- How to **pipe** data from one function to the next.

- How to **combine tidy functions** like `filter()` and `summarise()` in one pipeline.
