:mortar_board: An Introduction to R for the PSY260 Module at The University of Sunderland

# Installing R

Some details are provided below. Please note that Option 1 is preferable.

## Option 1: Local Install

### Download and install R

Follow the link to [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) to install R. Choose Download R for Linux, Mac (OS X), or Windows as appropriate and follow the install instructions.

### Download and install RStudio

Follow the link to [https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and select the free version of RStudio Desktop. Click download RStudio for Linux, Mac, or Windows as appropriate and follow the install instructions.

## Option 2: R in the Cloud

Register an account at [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/). Please note that you are limited to 15 hours per month at the free tier of this service at the time of writing.

## Option 3: R at the University of Sunderland

We will have local installations of R/RStudio for use on the computers in Psychology. These are controlled so that you do not have admin rights, so cannot install any additional packages. However, we will have the core packages (e.g. `here`, `tidyverse`) installed for you so you do not need to install any packages.
Seminars

# Following the Content

All seminars will involve working through the exercises in the seminars folder (described below). For the first seminar (split between an online and face to face session) we will use the face to face session as an opportunity for you to ask questions and engage in any troubleshooting in regards to your R installation and running R code.

Click the green Code button on this repository and click Download Zip and unzip the files. To do this either double click on the zipped folder (Mac) or right click and choose 7zip, Unzip here (PC). (Or use other methods if you are comfortable with GitHub.)

You now have access to everything I used to create the lectures and seminar content.

Please ensure that you are up to date with the lecture content stored in /lectures/ before completing the seminar content. 

In the /seminars/ folder there are subdirectories for each session. Please complete the main exercises before the additional, optional questions.

**IMPORTANT: PLEASE SAVE ANY UPDATED .RMD FILES ELSEWHERE ON YOUR COMPUTER. IF YOU RE-DOWNLOAD THE REPOSITORY, YOUR WORK MAY BE OVERWRITTEN (LOST).**

# Session 1: Introduction to R

Take the opportunity in this session to get to grips with R, catch up on any missed lecture videos, and complete the work below.

The content for all seminars is in the seminars folder.

For the first session, go into 01_intro-to-r. The content for this session is in the `01_seminar_intro-to-r.Rmd` and `01_seminar_intro-to-r.html` files.

Open the .html file in your browser (or double click it). This has some instructions on what to do in the seminar.

Once you have made your own RStudio Project and R markdown file within a folder on your computer, you can make changes to the R markdown file to complete the exercises from the `01_seminar-intro-to-r.html` file.

After making changes to your .Rmd file, click knit or preview (pictured below). This will update the .html file. This way you can see how your R code changes the output in the .html file.

1. Complete the exercises in the `01_seminar_intro-to-r.html` file.

2. After this, if you have time work through the `01_questions.Rmd` file. This has some empty R code chunks for you to add your own answers to.

Online and Face to Face sessions will be focused on this content. Face to face sessions simply offer an opportunity to ask questions and do more troubleshooting in person.

*In this session, and in future sessions, it may be best to copy and paste the entire /data/ folder into your Project directory. This will make loading data in R easier using the existing code from the exercises and questions.*

## Session 2: Managing and Cleaning Data in R

Use your same RStudio project (double click it) from the same folder you set up last time for your work. Please create a new R markdown file for storing your work from exercises etc. from this session and save it in this folder.

If you haven't done this yet, please make a folder somewhere on your computer where it will be safe, and create an RStudio Project in this folder (see instructions above from Session 1).

1. As in the previous session, please see the instructions in `psy260-r/seminars/02_managing-data-in-r/02_seminar_managing-data-in-r.html`.

You will have to copy and paste data from the `psy260-r/data/seminar_two_data.csv` file into your own folder where your RStudio project and R markdown files are located.

2. After this, if you have time work through the `02_questions.Rmd` file. This has some empty R code chunks for you to add your own answers to.

## Session 3: Summarising and Plotting Data in R

Use your same RStudio project (double click it) from the same folder you set up last time for your work. Please create a new R markdown file for storing your work from exercises etc. from this session and save it in this folder.

If you haven't done this yet, please make a folder somewhere on your computer where it will be safe, and create an RStudio Project in this folder (see instructions above from Session 1).

1. As in the previous session, please see the instructions in `psy260-r/seminars/03_summarising-data-in-r/03_seminar_summarising-data-in-r.html`.

You will have to copy and paste data from the `psy260-r/data/seminar_three_data.csv` and `psy260-r/data/cleanish_data.csv` files into your own folder where your RStudio project and R markdown files are located.

2. After this, if you have time work through the `03_questions.Rmd` file. This has some empty R code chunks for you to add your own answers to.
